## CI pipeline

CI is utilizing [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). Complete GitHub Actions config is located in the [.github/workflows](.github/workflows) folder.

### PR Verification

Series of workflows runs (in parallel) for every opened PR and after merging PR to `main` branch:
* `./gradlew lintDebug` - runs Android lint
* `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest` - run unit tests

## Upcoming improvements
- Increase tests coverage in the data layer.
- Improve code quality.

## Known issues
- Leaky memory: this issue produced when the user navigate from FeedFragment to BlogDetailFragment before the image loading is complete and vice-versa.

## Inspiration

This is project is to inspire you and should handle most of the common cases, but please take a look at
additional resources.
