## CI pipeline

CI is utilizing [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). Complete GitHub Actions config is located in the [.github/workflows](.github/workflows) folder.

### PR Verification

Series of workflows runs (in parallel) for every opened PR and after merging PR to `main` branch:
* `./gradlew lintDebug` - runs Android lint
* `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest` - run unit tests

## Upcoming improvements
- Increase tests coverage in the data layer.
- Improve code quality

## Known issues
- Leaky memory: this issue produced when the user navigate from FeedFrgment to BlogDetailFragment before the image loading is complete and vice-versa.
- search query is not saved when the orientation is changed.
- app crashing when the bottom sheet is displayed and the orientation is changed.
- social media authentication seems not working properly
